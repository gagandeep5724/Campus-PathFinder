- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Flask

## Steps to Run

### Fork the Repository

1. **Setting Up the Frontend**

   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```

   - Install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

   - Run the application:
     ```bash
     npm run start
     ```

2. **Setting Up the Backend**

   - **Install Python**

     Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) if it's not already installed.

   - **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

     It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create one by running:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```

     - **Activate the Virtual Environment**

       Depending on your operating system, activate the virtual environment:

       - **Windows:**
         ```bash
         venv\Scripts\activate
         ```

       - **macOS/Linux:**
         ```bash
         source venv/bin/activate
         ```

   - **Navigate to the Backend Directory**

     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```

   - **Install Required Packages**

     Install the necessary Python packages using pip. The main packages you need for this application are Flask and Flask-CORS:
     ```bash
     pip install Flask Flask-CORS
     ```


   - **Run the Flask Application**

     Start the Flask application using the following command:
     ```bash
     python server.py
     ```
